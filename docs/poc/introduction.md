Here you find a short introduction of the mechanisms used by this repository.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allow for creating web sites for you and your projects. Either use one site per GitHub account and organization, or create unlimited project sites. The clcdocs repository was created as an organization site, i.e. clcdocs is an organization on GitHub and the clcdocs repository has been created for this organization.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is used as static site generator. GitHub Pages is deeply integrated with Jekyll. The main advantages of Jekyll are:

* [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is used instead of HTML. Markdown is simpler to read and write.
* Common templates are used as headers and footers that are shared across files. Jekyll automatically updates when new content is pushed to GitHub.
* The build process is simplified for build the web site.
* Jekyll comes with a build-in development server that allows you to preview what the generated site will look like in your browser locally. Click [here](docs/poc/installing) for instructions on how to install this development server.
